'''The program:
You are caught by maths geeks and they won't free you until you solve a problem. You need to save your life by solving the problem.

They give you two integers N and K. You must find the smallest and the largest positive integers each containing exactly N digits and having exactly K distinct digits from 0 to 9.

For example: 99987 has only 3 distinct digits 9, 8 and 7.

Obviously, leading 0’s are not allowed, for example: 0145 is not allowed. Input is given such that the answer will always exist.

INPUT:
Line 1: Number of digits N and number of distinct digits K

OUTPUT:
Line 1: Print the smallest and the largest number (space separated).

CONSTRAINTS:
1 ≤ N ≤ 18
1 ≤ K ≤ 10

EXAMPLE:
Input
3 3
Output
102 987

Input
13 9
Output
1000002345678 9999987654321

Input
